name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request 
# events but only for the develop branch 
on: 
  push: 
    branches: [ main ] 
  pull_request: 
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel 
jobs: 
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build" 
  hello: 
    # The type of runner that the job will run on 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps: 
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it 
      #- uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
